## Local Storage Keys

The application uses the following localStorage keys:
- `timerState`: Stores timer configuration, state, and timing data
- `stopwatchState`: Stores stopwatch elapsed time, running state, and timing data

### Timer State Structure:
```javascript
{
  totalTime: number,        // Total timer duration in milliseconds
  remainingTime: number,    // Remaining time in milliseconds
  isRunning: boolean,       // Whether timer is currently running
  isFinished: boolean,      // Whether timer has completed
  startTime: number | null, // When timer was started (timestamp)
  lastUpdateTime: number    // Last update timestamp for accuracy
}
```

### Stopwatch State Structure:
```javascript
{
  time: number,             // Elapsed time in milliseconds
  isRunning: boolean,       // Whether stopwatch is currently running
  startTime: number | null, // When stopwatch was started (timestamp)
  lastUpdateTime: number    // Last update timestamp for accuracy
}
```

## Development
